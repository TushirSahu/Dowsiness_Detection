# Drowsiness Detection OpenCV 😴 🚫 🚗
This code can detect your eyes and alert when the user is drowsy.
## Applications 🎯
This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents

## Code Requirements 🦄
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 

## Packages Required

1) Open-CV
2) Matplotlib
3) Pytorch
4) Keras


## Description 📌

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then tells if the driver appears to be drowsy.
It can aslo be used for detection on the images across all formats.

## Algorithm 👨‍🔬

CNN-based Object Detectors are primarily applicable for recommendation systems. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are used for Object detection with high performance. YOLO divides an image into a grid system, and each grid detects objects within itself. They can be used for real-time object detection based on the data streams.The head of the YOLO v5 model is the same as in the previous YOLO V3 and V4 editions.
Here a pretrained model is used from the official yolov5 repo (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
